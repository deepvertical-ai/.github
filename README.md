# Deep Vertical AI - On-Premises Financial Intelligence Systems

## Company Overview

Deep Vertical AI deploys production financial intelligence systems within client security perimeters. We solve the fundamental challenge that financial institutions face: how to leverage cutting-edge AI while ensuring data never leaves their security environment and maintains adherence to their information security standards.

## Core Differentiator: On-Premises Security

### Your Data Never Leaves Your Security Perimeter

- **InfoSec Adherence**: We follow your information security standards at every step of build, test, and deployment
- **Complete Operational Independence**: Full source code transfer ensures you maintain and evolve systems independently

### No Other Consultancy Does This
We are the only financial AI consultancy that combines:
- On-premises deployment within client cloud environments
- Complete intellectual property transfer
- Adherence to client security standards throughout the process
- Multi-cloud deployment expertise (Azure, GCP, AWS)
